# Histograms-Using-Threads-Project
This is a project I developed that uses threads to efficiently create a histogram based on the characters in an input file. Compatible with .jpg .bmn and .txt
It uses two methods, a global vector and multiple local vectors, to map an input file into corresponding bins. 
The program is designed to run from the command line, with input taking the form "main.cpp <filename>". For example, run using "main.cpp testFile.txt".
